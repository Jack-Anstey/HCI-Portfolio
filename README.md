# Human Computer Interaction Portfolio

## Welcome to my Portfolio!
This project was developed for Emory University's CS 485: Human Computer Interaction course.

## About
This is a collection of all my individual and group projects that were completed throughout the HCI course. All of these projects are hosted on Medium with full writeups and highly detailed descriptions.

## My Design Manifesto
This website also has a link to my design manifesto where I describe my current design process and my learning throughout this course.

## Host Location
The code will be hosted on my personal website [here](https://jackanstey.com/portfolio.html). Enjoy!

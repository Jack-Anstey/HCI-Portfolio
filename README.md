# Human Computer Interaction Portfolio

## Welcome to my Portfolio!
This project was developed for Emory University's CS 485: Human Computer Interaction course.

## About
This is a collection of all my individual and group projects that were completed throughout the HCI course. All of these projects are hosted on Medium with full writeups and highly detailed descriptions.

This project was written entirely by me and uses a combination of HTML 5, Bootstrap, and my own SCSS/CSS code.

## My Design Manifesto
This website also hosts my design manifesto where I describe my current design process and my learning throughout this course.

					<h2>Design Manifesto</h2>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class = "row justify-text pb-5 px-5">
				<div class = "container">
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Most of us (like myself) interact with computers daily. I use my laptop during school, my phone to communicate with friends, my Switch to play games, and my desktop at home. Each of these devices all have explicit purposes and therefore the ways in which I interact with them all differ. Even though these are all computers, why are my interactions different?</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">They’re different because each if these devices use software that was explicitly designed that way. Thousands of hours have been spent pouring over every interaction, each button, each outcome, and all edge cases to create an experience tailored towards their users. Even with all this effort, sometimes the user experience doesn’t feel like it was specifically tailored for you, or it can even feel bad. Why is that?</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Well, if a design doesn’t objectively belong to the Hall of Shame, why is that some designs don’t feel meant for you? I’d argue that while you cannot please and cater for everyone, you can still design with the intention of making things as accessible and as universal as possible. Doing this limits the amount of people that would feel that a design is not meant for them. This is the core tenant of my design philosophy.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">That doesn’t mean that a design is specifically meant for a specific user group, however. Finding a balance between accessibility and relatability is my goal as a designer and it is met through my individual design process. My design process begins with empathy through needfinding, moves into prototyping using the multi-millennia old technology of paper and pencils, then I rapidly creating a mid-fi prototype on Figma, which then leads into me refining my favored designs with a focus on accessibility. My design process allows designs that are both user-centered and accessible. In my mind, the best of both worlds.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">This all starts with the foundation of my design process which is needfinding.</div><br><br>

					<div class = "fs-4">
						<h3>Needfinding</h3>
					</div>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">User centered design can’t be user centered if you can’t define your user’s needs! Therefore, my design process starts here. </div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Needfinding, fundamentally, is talking folks that fit a particular user persona and conducting ethnographic-esque interviews with them. </div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Why are these interviews important? Well, we all make assumptions about the world and how it works. However, in making assumptions we can often find that our view of something conflicts with someone else’s view, especially when the conflicting views come from the users that you are designing for are not you! Needfinding interviews then serve the purpose of discovery and illuminating key issues in that user group.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">In my time in Human Computer Interaction was this no more important than the “Needfinding for Airport Design” project. For this project, I chose to interview college aged (18-22) folk and their experiences getting to and from the airport. In what ways did they do so? What did they like or dislike about the way they got the airport? This illuminated some super interesting issues for me that I hadn’t considered even though I am a part of that user group! </div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">For instance, one of the people that I interviewed is by all accounts, an introvert. The last thing he wants to do is talk to strangers. He then chose a method that would be unheard of in Atlanta for getting to and from the airport: the subway. He enjoys people watching, the convenience since its close to where he lives, and he gets to people watch in silence. These are none of my personal priorities though I would have no idea they were anyone’s preferences if I were to not conduct a needfinding interview.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">I also find needfinding to be extremely important as it can help significantly reduce bias. This is true if and only if the person that is conducting an interview makes the conscious effort to ask questions and conduct an interview with the purpose of reducing bias. This means going with the flow of what the person that you are interviewing is saying and coming in as a blank slate: your assumptions and prior biases don’t mean anything since in this context you don’t have any. This also means not interrupting or asking charged questions. This is hard, but worth it to not only gain the most accurate data possible, but to engage with opinions and viewpoints that you may have never considered before.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">When you conclude needfinding, it can be tempting to take your findings and jump directly into a design. This is an expensive mistake. Not only in the monetary cost of your or someone’s else’s company dollars, but in your own time in making something that was ultimately fruitless. How can my design process circumvent this problem and avoid sunk cost entirely? Paper prototyping comes to the rescue.</div><br><br>

					<div class = "fs-4">
						<h3>Paper Prototypes</h3>
					</div>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">At first glance it may seem odd to use paper to model digital interactions. After all, user interfaces on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers all use gesture mechanics, tapping, touching, and clicking, none of which can be supported by paper. So beyond being physically inexpensive, what’s the purpose of using paper? And how can we use it to prototype?</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Paper prototyping is the process of making tons of different designs and interactions just by placing it down on paper. Here you can model button placement, the style of buttons and text, images, and whatever else you can imagine! The benefit of this is while it may look messy, there is no faster way to make prototypes. In this early stage of the design process this is essential as you do not make just one paper prototype. The measure of final quality of a project is correlated with the number of paper prototypes with more being better.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">The issue of paper not being an interactive medium can also be mitigated by literally moving them around! As we found out in our very first group project, using pieces of paper and acting as a computer, while cumbersome, can again illuminate shortcomings or misunderstandings in how your target audience uses your prototype. For instance, some users when using our initial paper prototype liked to navigate back to the home screen between each of the tasks we asked them to do, even though it would have been much faster to use the nav menu to go directly to the correct location.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">The resulting follow up question that we had to answer was why? This was not a user behavior that we expected, nor is it the optimal way to navigate the website. Answering this question proved to be a bit tricky. We had to decipher the true cause of that happening. The person acting as the computer may have “reset” the website to be back at the home screen, so the user may have been following their lead. The user may have believed that they had to go home for the website to work, as in being the computer you aren’t supposed to explain every button and interaction since that would defeat the purpose of the test. It could have even been the paper itself! We had laid pieces of paper on top of each other to simulate the navbar being interacted with which may have caused some confusion on how it worked.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">With this experience, it is clear that paper prototypes don’t provide all the answers and in instances where confounding variables are present, using your best judgement is sometimes the only way to move forward. It still an extremely valuable tool and even these confounding moments can still yield some useful data.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">My paper prototypes are often…unattractive. It can also miss some of the nuance of the true vision I have for a particular design. Jumping directly from a paper prototype to the real thing is again, expensive. Is there some intermediary step that can be taken between the two that can put my paper prototype to the test without spending days of coding on it? Yes! If paper prototyping is lo-fi (low fidelity), there are then tools for mid-fi and hi-fi prototypes too! I found the most success in using mid-fi prototyping, so my design process follows suit.</div><br><br>

					<div class = "fs-4">
						<h3>Mid-Fi Prototypes</h3>
					</div>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Mid-fi prototypes bridge the gap between making a complete design and having one made from paper. I view it as bringing the paper to life where outside of features like payment can all be modeled exactly the way that you want it. Swiping, tapping, scrolling, and navigating can all be modeled the exact way that I imagined in my head without the hassle of coding. Its still much slower than making a paper prototype, however, so mid-fi prototypes fit perfectly into the middle of my design process.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">The most recent mid-fi prototype that I created with a group, a mobile version of the Fox Theatre desktop website, was my favorite use case thus far. Once we had completed our paper prototypes and learned about what our users liked and didn’t like about our previous mid-fi prototype, we could jump in immediately. Need an asset, just copy and paste! One button allowed you to tile images and one click in a context menu could allow to repeatedly use the same assets for each page and have them be all edited at the same time. We used that last feature for our hamburger menu since that would be a part of every page and every user would expect it to be the same for every page.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">This also allowed me to provide a much higher level of detail than I could ever dream in a paper prototype. Here, I could try out different typefaces and colors, something that is much more difficult to do on paper. I also had the freedom to allow Figma to be the computer on my behalf. I could just send a link to my friends and have them try it out – removing the bias issue of the human computer and shuffling papers entirely out of the equation.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Being able to allow others to test it also provided an avenue for further refinement without devoting too much of a sunk cost into the design. An underrated feature of Figma too is that it provides CSS, iOS, and Android styling code so if you want to plug in an element just like it is on Figma into your final product, you can again just copy and paste!</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Needfinding, paper prototypes, and mid-fi prototypes do not cover the entirety of my design process, however. These are all necessary steps to reach the stage of final development, but there is only portion of design that I am constantly thinking about during each of these stages, including making the final product: universal design.</div><br><br>

					<div class = "fs-4">
						<h3>Universal Design</h3>
					</div>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Universal design is a school of thought where accessibility is a number one concern. It focuses on concepts like: equitable use, flexibility in use, being simple and intuitive, and taking low amount of physical effort. The beauty of universal design is that when you use these rules, user experiences are often made that not only benefit your target user, but others that you didn’t expect. One such real world example is curb cuts. Curb cuts are great for those who have physical disabilities as it makes getting above a curb and onto a sidewalk a non-issue. This also benefits able-bodied folk like people using a stroller or bicyclists since they don’t have to do any extra movements to get above curbs either.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Another example of universal design is paying attention to the use of colors on a website. If you have a graph where you divide different groups by color, some folks with color blindness will have a difficult to impossible time telling the difference. Instead, you can divide by texture or use a set of colors where colorblind folk can tell the difference. This too benefits everyone: now the graph is objectively easier to read!</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">What does it look like to use universal design tenants in practice? Well, reading this manifesto means you’ve already experienced it! My design for this website was motivated by matching the demands of my users while adhering to universal design principles.</div><br><br>

					<div class = "fs-4">
						<h3>Design Refinement: How can this be Accessible?</h3>
					</div>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">With the core pillars of universal design in mind, I set out to have my future projects in this course (and beyond) to adhere to it. With each button and feature that I thought of that matched with the user personas and needs of the groups that I discovered, I always thought “how can this be accessible?” Using this basic mantra, I made many modifications to my design that can either be seen or felt all throughout this website that you are on right now.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">As I began to code my website, I thought about the nitty gritty details. What typeface would I use? What colors would I use? What frameworks would I use? How can I have my website load quickly and run on most devices? How would I do all of this while developing everything in a reasonable timeframe? I found my answer in Bootstrap.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Bootstrap is a CSS framework that has built in tools to manage objects, colors, divisions, and text. As detailed in the <a class = "link-style" href = "https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/#native-font-stack"  target="_blank">Bootstrap documentation</a>, all typefaces are designed to be native. This means that no matter your device and operating system, such as Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android, it will use a typeface that is already on your device. This means that nothing needs to be downloaded from a server, which can vastly increase the length of load times. This makes the experience of using this website better for literally everyone.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Bootstrap also increases the speed of development time. Instead of having to define many flexbox attributes to organize the content on my website, instead I can use containers, row, and col attributes that have already been defined by Bootstrap. Instead, I can spend my time using SCSS to create things like boxes and font awesome icons that get larger with box shadows once a user hovers over them.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">Bootstrap continues to serve more purposes when examining the continuity between my webpage and Medium. Most of the content is hosting links to Medium articles that I have written. Therefore, it is in my best interest to design the website using similar fonts and colors that Medium uses. Well, I know <a class = "link-style" href = "https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/#what-to-do-today"  target="_blank">Medium</a> uses the same typeface as Bootstrap does so reading between the two websites will be similar. In addition, the colors that I use which are white, black and a very light grey, are the exact same as Medium. I was able to create the lines that adorn the left and right edges of the webpage just like they are on Medium too.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">The colors that Medium uses also provide another benefit: contrast. Text and a background color with poor contrast can make it extremely difficult to impossible for those that have color blindness to read. Even for a person that is not colorblind, sometimes a lack of contrast can still make reading much more difficult than it needs to be. Since my colors are white, black, and light grey, there is literally no option that provides more contrast. The issues with color blindness are also mitigated since for those that can see, seeing the differences between black and white are easy.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">What if a person has difficulty seeing or what if they are blind? I made sure to think about this as I developed my website, using appropriate tags such as &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and &lt;p&gt; where appropriate. For example, I made sure to follow <a class = "link-style" href = "http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/code/navigation/"  target="_blank">Web Accessibility Guidelines</a> so that my navigation menu would make sense if someone was using text to speech to navigate through menus.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">To put my website through its paces, I tested it my eyes closed and used Google Vox, the Google Chrome screen reader. Most things worked as I hope but to my dismay, the alternate text that I had supplied the images with made very little sense with my eyes closed. I still had the ability to open my eyes, but how would my descriptions ever have a hope of making sense to those who couldn’t? I made my descriptions much more accurate based on this experience, even though most users will never look at the alternative text of the images on my website.</div><br>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">This is why asking the question “how can this be accessible” is so important. Even with the best of intentions, I still made some oversights. Extra time and effort are needed in order to do these things but knowing that it provides a universal benefit makes that investment worth it.</div><br>

					<div class = "fs-4">
						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					</div>
					<div class = "indent fs-4">My designs are always a work in progress. I know that these steps that I take will evolve over time, the technologies I use will change, and what matters today may not matter tomorrow. My design process, however, will be something that I can always come back to. It will certainly be refined over time as I create my own style and learn more about what it means to make my designs accessible, but its roots will stay the same: my designs will be user centered and accessible, creating an equitable experience for all.</div>
